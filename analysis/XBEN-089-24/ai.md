# AI Analysis

> **Provenance note — 2026-10-19:** These notes summarize an AI-assisted analysis prepared for the challenge documentation. They must not be treated as verbatim transcripts of CTF Assistant's interactions with participants P04–P06, or as evidence of a particular retrieval from the Knowledge Base. The challenge is a browser-based web application; example HTTP requests describe application behavior, not a requirement to use a command-line terminal.


## Objective

The objective was to understand how the authentication and authorization mechanisms were implemented in the application, and to identify potential vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access to the admin dashboard.

## Context

The application is a Flask-based web system with:

- A login mechanism

- Role-based access control (employee vs admin)

- A 2FA step for admin users

At first glance, the presence of:

- a SQL injection filter

- a 2FA mechanism

suggested that the challenge might involve exploiting these components.

## Prompt

Analyze the following Flask login logic and identify possible vulnerabilities, focusing on authentication, authorization, and input validation.

## AI Output

The AI initially suggested:

- Testing for SQL injection due to weak input validation

- Investigating the 2FA mechanism for possible bypass

- Reviewing how user input is handled in the login process

Later, it highlighted:

- The role parameter is controlled by the client

- The server stores the role directly in the session without verifying it against the database

- This could lead to privilege escalation

## Evaluation

### Correct Aspects

- Correctly identified the importance of analyzing how user input is handled

- Highlighted the trust boundary between client and server

- Eventually recognized the core issue: improper use of the role parameter

- Suggested focusing on session management and authorization logic

### Incorrect or Misleading Aspects

- Initial focus on SQL injection was misleading, since:

  - The query is parameterized

  - SQL injection is not exploitable in this case

- Overemphasis on 2FA as a potential target:

  - The 2FA mechanism is weak, but not the main vulnerability

  - It does not affect authorization decisions

### Missing Reasoning

- The AI did not immediately identify the key flaw:

  - The server ignores the role returned by the database

- It did not clearly distinguish between:

  - Authentication (credential validation)

  - Authorization (role assignment and access control)

- It did not explicitly recognize this as a business logic vulnerability from the start

## Impact on Analysis

- Did it help?  
  > Yes, especially in guiding the analysis toward input handling and session usage

- Did it slow you down?  
  > Slightly, due to initial focus on SQL injection and 2FA

- Did it introduce wrong assumptions?  
  > Yes:

  - That SQL injection might be relevant

  - That bypassing 2FA was necessary to reach the flag

## Conclusion

The AI was useful as a supporting tool but required critical evaluation.

Its main contribution was helping to identify the trust boundary issue between client and server. However, it initially focused on common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, 2FA bypass), which were not relevant to the actual exploit.

The most important insight --- that the application trusts a client-controlled role parameter for authorization --- emerged only after deeper manual analysis.

Overall, the interaction demonstrates that AI can assist in vulnerability discovery, but cannot replace critical thinking, especially when dealing with business logic flaws.
